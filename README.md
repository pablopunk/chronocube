Simple app to time your Rubik's Cube solves.

![icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pablopunk/chronocube/master/src/img/icon200px.png)

This app is cross-platform as it's created with *HTML+CSS+JS* and it's packaged on *[Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron)*, a tool to create apps from webapps, so you can use it as a native app on your desktop.

## Build and Package

Make sure you have the dependencies installed (instructions are found in each page, but this is how you do it on OS X):

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [electron-builder](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager) and [electron-packager](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager)

    ```shell
  npm install electron-packager -g
  npm install electron-builder -g
  # windows builds in no windows platforms
  brew install wine makensis # asks for XQuartz install
    ```

Use the *MAKEFILE* to build the executable for all platforms:

- `make all`:
  * creates all builds inside `build/`
  * creates apps for mac and win inside `dist/`
- Specific arquitectures:
  * `make osx`
  * `make win`
  * `make linux32`
  * `make linux64`
  * `make linux` (both `ia32` and `x64`)
