>Simple app to time your Rubik's Cube solves

This app is cross-platform as it's created with *HTML+CSS+JS* and it's packaged on *[Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron)*, a tool to create apps from webapps, so you can use it as a native app on your desktop.

  npm install electron-builder -g
  # windows builds on mac
  brew install wine makensis # asks for XQuartz install
    ```

Use the *MAKEFILE* to build the executable for all platforms:

- `make all`:
  * creates all builds inside `build/`

  * `make osx`
  * `make win`
  * `make linux32`
  * `make linux64`
